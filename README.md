# ML_Classification


## Classification Analysis

Python implementation of ML techniques like Naive Bayes and SVM for classification of text and handwritten digits respectively. Further description given in the [Assignment problem statement](https://github.com/udayinbiswas/ML_Classification/blob/master/Assignment_2.pdf)

### Usage:
Data will soon be made available.. To run the main code:
#### Naive Bayes:
* To build the model, execute `python Q1/linregAB.py`
* To do predictions, 
#### SVM:
* To build the model, execute `python Q1/linregAB.py`
* To do predictions, execute `python Q1/linregAB.py`

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Python libraries
  * Numpy
